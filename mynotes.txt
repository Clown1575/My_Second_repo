Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code and collaborate with others efficiently. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work, using branches and merging features.With Git, teams can maintain a full history of changes, making it easier to review, revert, or manage code versions.
